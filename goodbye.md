# Hachimi has been discontinued

## For newcomers
### Please use [Hachimi Edge](https://hachimi.noccu.art/)
If you're just looking for how to install Hachimi, you're probably in the wrong place right now. Please use [Hachimi Edge](https://hachimi.noccu.art/) instead, which is an actively maintained fork of Hachimi by the community that works on the latest version of the game. I (LeadRDRK) do not have any direct involvement on this project.

## Farewell
*[17th January, 2026]*

After a very long period of going MIA and not working on the project at all, it's been long overdue for me to call it quits. Well, better late than never.

I started this project in my first year of college, when I still had a lot of free time. Back when the game was still pretty niche, and there was basically no mods for the Android version at all. I had just learned about Uma Musume, immediately fell in love with it, and decided to take matters into my own hands.

Fast forward to 2025, Hachimi has become the only viable mod if you wanted to play the JP version of the game with English translations, among other languages. And with the launch of the global version, people started flocking in to use it for the game enhancement features too.

What started as a small personal project has now turned into an extremely high maintenance project that supported multiple platforms and multiple versions of the game. It was a cat and mouse game with Cy constantly trying to prevent game modding, and that broke Hachimi every few months. This used to be a fun challenge for me, but everything has a limit, and after a few of these rounds going back and forth to try and fix Hachimi, it was no longer enjoyable to watch my mod break when it's not even my fault. Updating the mod became a huge burden to me.

On top of that, I still had to maintain what I referred to as the "official English TL repo". I only had myself to blame here; I was constantly pouring responsibilities on top of more responsibilities. As a result, I had created unrealistic expectations for myself, and with my final year of college fast approaching, I had very little free time to fulfill these expectations.

It became a vicious cycle. The more I didn't work on the project, the more expectations I put on myself, and the more expectations I put on myself, the more I felt like not working on the project because I don't have enough time to do it properly, not to mention my mental capacity. I still really wanted to work on the project. I told myself that I didn't have any rights to show my face to the community until I properly updated the mod for them. I went MIA. Because I was embarrassed of myself. I'm scared of seeing people's expectations and not being able to fulfill it for them. I thought to myself that people would've been seeing me as a useless mannequin by now and I had no dignity left in front of their faces.

But eventually, I realized that I no longer have the time or the mental capacity to work on this project properly ever again. I have completely lost my motivation.

A couple of folks in the Discord server randomly pinged me sometimes which prompted me to check out what's going on in the community from time to time. Believe me, I was ***reeeaaally*** scared to see what people had to say about me every time I was pinged. Not like I was annoyed by it or anything though, I really appreciated the fact that some of you still care about me. Eventually, I realized that no one meant any harm to me (shocking, I know) - people were even expecting me to come back after all this time! Unfortunately, I have made up my mind, and that was of course, no longer possible. The reality is clear: I was just gonna actually create a burden on the community and myself if I just sat on this project trying to force myself to revive a dead horse and abandoning it without giving people a proper resolution.

That leads us to today. I'm finally officially announcing that I will no longer be working on this project. Starting from now, the Hachimi organization on GitHub will no longer be active. Most repos under the organization have been archived, although some are still open. These repos are managed by external contributors and will stay open for as long as their maintainer would like.

...And I think that's everything I have to say. Thank you all for using Hachimi, especially those who have tried it out in the early days, and those who have given me critical feedback on this project to help it become what it is today. A very massive thanks to the translators who have entrusted this project to be the host of their translations, and those who have directly contributed code to the project, I really, really appreciate you guys. I couldn't have done it without everyone involved.

If you'd like to learn about my future endeavors, you may follow my Twitter account [@LeadRDRK](https://x.com/LeadRDRK). I don't tweet frequently though, so please don't expect much from me @_@

Goodbye.
