Hachimi Edge is a fork of the unmaintained [Hachimi](https://hachimi.leadrdrk.com) mod. It was made to fix issues after the game update on 2025/09/24 and has since incorporated additional features and fixes by various community members. Should Hachimi's developer return, Edge will likely be merged back and discontinued.
