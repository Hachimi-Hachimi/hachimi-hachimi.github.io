# Welcome
Welcome to the Hachimi translation guide! This guide will introduce you to the Hachimi translation system, how it works and how to use the ZokuZoku translation tool.

## Glossary
Before reading the guide, be sure to familiarize yourself with a few terminologies which will be used throughout the articles.
- **Dict (Dictionary):** Used to refer to the translation files which are used in a similar manner to dictionaries, the translation system will look up entries in these files to retrieve suitable translations.
- **Repo (Repository):** If you've never heard of this term in the context of [Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) before, you can simply interpret it as "the place where the translations are stored". When this term is used, it usually refers to one of two types of repo: Git repository (used for version control/collaboration) or TL repository (used by Hachimi for translation updates). The former of which is the one that will be commonly referred to, the latter mainly concerns repo maintainers and will be explained more in depth in its own article.
- **Meta (Metadata):** Supplementary info for something. In the context of Hachimi translation dicts, this usually refers to a special entry within the dict for asset files that specifies their bundle hash.
- **TL:** Short for "translation".
- **Dir (Directory):** Fancy way of calling "folder".
- **ZokuZoku:** It's the name of the main Hachimi translation tool. *Also Transcend's catchphrase*.
